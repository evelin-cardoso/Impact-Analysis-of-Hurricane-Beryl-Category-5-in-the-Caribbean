Impact Analysis of Hurricane Beryl (Category 5) in the Caribbean
This project aims to analyze the impact and trajectory of Hurricane Beryl, a Category 5 hurricane, which is the first of its kind to hit the Caribbean in the month of June. Using data provided by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and other meteorological sources, we explore the hurricane's path, intensity, and potential damage to infrastructure, residential areas, and the environment. Various types of visualizations, including 2D and 3D plots, as well as interactive charts, are used to present the findings.
